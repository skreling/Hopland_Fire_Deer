Using the files 'far.csv' and 'MCP_Centroids.csv' (found in 'Collars' under 'Publication_Data'), we created a distance matrix in QGIS. To do this, we filtered the MCP centroids to only pre-fire homerange centroids and used the 'distance matrix' function in base QGIS. Here we will extract only the values of displacement between pre and post-fire individual deer.

```{r}
distances <- read.csv(here::here("Publication_Data",'Collars','distances.csv'))
distances.same.deer <- distances[c(distances$TargetID==distances$InputID),]
write.csv(distances.same.deer,'Distances_During_Fire_QGIS.csv')
```
